Below is the technical test for you! Please do let us know if you have any questions! You can email us at: tech@tripcanvas.co!
Best of luck!

Technical description
===========

We expect you to be familiar with the following and show the ability in your coding!
-------------

### Frontend technologies:

* ECMA 6
* Frontend framework e.g. ReactJS with Redux
* Webpack
* HTML/CSS as needed

### Backend technologies:

* NodeJS
* MongoDB

### Testing

* Functional testing
* Unit testing

Goals
---------
We would like you to see if you can build a hotel listing application! Sample schema of a hotel 
```
{
  id: 1,
  title: "Aloft Hotel",
  image: "",
  facilities: [
    "breakfast_included" : true,
    "accepts_credit_card" : true,
    "internet" : "1Gbps wifi"
  ],
  average_price : 400,
  currency : "RM",
  star_rating: 5
}
```
Here are the goals:

## Goal 1
Prepare your backend application using NodeJS and Express. This application will serve information of hotels using REST API. Prepare some mock APIs.

Note: This is your opportunity to show your backend skills. Please try over-engineering and showoff your skills!

## Goal 2
Create listing page with pagination using React and Redux. Users can select any hotel as their favourite. Indicator of favourite should not go away with page refresh.

* You should have an application route called /hotels
* On this route, render a page showing the hotels
* You should use Webpack to optimize, pack your assets, and serve to browser!
* Bonus points for isomorphic coding and server side rendering!

Note: This is your opportunity to show your JS skills. Try over-engineering! Use advanced JS features like Async/Await, Generators, Event based operations whenever possible!

## Goal 3

Suppose you have an article. Now you need to prepare the a table of content using Material-UI like this link: https://material-ui.com/demos/grid-list/

```
JSON for Table of contents.
```
```
"tableOfContent": [
{
"text": "Introduction of the article",
"link": "introduction",
"order": 0
},
{
"text": "Indulge in an outdoor spa experience: SAARAH Day Spa/Tea Spa by SAARAH",
"link": 1,
"order": 1
},
{
"text": "Slide in a bathtub filled with rose petals: Qorinah Day Spa",
"link": 2,
"order": 2
},
{
"text": "Value-for-money quality spa packages with 7 treatments!: Jogja Traditional Treatment Spa",
"link": 3,
"order": 3
},
{
"text": "Itâ€™s so exclusive, they only welcome 4 guests at a time!: Monggo Relax Spa",
"link": 4,
"order": 4
},
{
"text": "Summary",
"link": "summary",
"order": 5
}
]
```

* If user does not select any hotel as favourite, recommended hotels will be empty.
* If user selects any hotel as favourite, recommended hotels would be those hotels that have same features but cheaper.
* Send a push notification to browser if you find any recommended hotel.

Be aware that if you change any input it should change the recommended hotel accordingly 

## Goal 4
Last but not the least, testing! You can follow TDD or FDD!

* There should be a way to test all the functionalities of your app!
* Write functional tests!
* Write unit tests!

### Submit your code
- Please don't forget to write your readme file which should contain what/why your have done things in certain way! Documentation is highly appreciated!
- Your solution should be committed back into this repository like you would do in a normal project.
- You can commit and push as many times as you want.
- We value a clean coding style. It would be nice if you follow something like Airbnb's JavaScript Style Guide!

Best of luck!
